# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Changed

<a id="quiet-image-build"></a>

- **The release image builds without warnings or notices from Kiln's own
  steps.** The GHCR build log for v1.8.0 carried about 260 warnings and
  notices. Kiln's own steps produced four kinds, each now gone:
  - Tailwind's CSS optimizer warned that `::highlight(kiln-issue)` is not a
    valid pseudo-element. It is one (the CSS Custom Highlight API), but
    Lightning CSS doesn't know it. The rule now lives in `advisory_jump.js`
    as a constructed stylesheet, adopted the first time a highlight is drawn.
  - `npm ci` printed its "new major version" and "looking for funding"
    notices. The image pins its own npm, so the build passes
    `--no-update-notifier --no-fund`.
  - The two-scheduler `mix compile` pushed dozens of files past the
    "taking more than 10s" notice. The image build raises the threshold;
    dev keeps the default.
  - `mix release` printed "skipping elixir.bat/iex.bat for windows". The
    release now sets `include_executables_for: [:unix]`.

  On the dependency side, ash_phoenix 2.3.26, ash_paper_trail 0.8.1,
  ranch 2.3.0, makeup 1.2.3 and phoenix_template 1.1.0 compile cleanly on
  Elixir 1.20, removing about 20 warnings. The OTP 29 deprecation warnings
  in yamerl, gproc, gen_smtp and chatterbox (`catch Expr`, exported
  subexpression variables, `lists:zf/2`) are switched off for the
  `deps.compile` step only, through the compiler's own `nowarn_*` options.
  The app's sources still compile with every warning on. The rest are Elixir
  1.20 warnings inside third-party packages whose latest releases still
  carry them. Fixing those needs upstream releases.

## Security

<a id="ash-sql-0-8-6"></a>

- **ash_sql 0.8.4 → 0.8.6.** Hex retired 0.8.4 as a security release:
  "Ecto query cache issue causes unpredictable query returns". `mix
  hex.audit` reports it, and v1.8.0's image ships it. 0.8.6 is the fix
  Hex names. It turned up while bumping deps for the quiet image build
  above.
