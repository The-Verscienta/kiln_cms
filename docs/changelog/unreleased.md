# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Upgrade notes

<a id="search-name-lexemes-upgrade"></a>

- **Content tables gain `name_lexemes`, a generated column; overlays run
  `mix ash.codegen` to add it to their own content types.** The column is
  `GENERATED ALWAYS … STORED` from `search_weighted`, so the migration
  fills it for every existing row and Postgres keeps it current on every
  write. Adding a stored generated column rewrites the table under an
  exclusive lock: seconds for a catalogue of a few thousand rows, longer for
  a very large table. Until an overlay's own types have the column, their
  alias and compound legs answer empty and log why, so generate and migrate
  before deploying. No re-fire is needed: a row written before 1.8, with no
  `search_weighted`, still takes the full match.

<a id="form-field-types-upgrade"></a>

- **Forms: the new field types need every node on this release.** `field_type`
  is stored as text, so adding values needs no enum migration, but Ash casts a
  stored atom with `String.to_existing_atom`: a node still running the previous
  release cannot load a row naming `radio`, `rating` and the rest, and the public
  form page fails to load. Rolling back the image therefore breaks any form that
  uses a new type. Don't add one until the rollout has finished. The migration
  itself is expand-only (three nullable float columns on `form_fields`).

## Added

<a id="form-field-types"></a>

- **Forms: `radio`, `checkboxes`, `phone`, `url`, `hidden`, `number` and `rating`
  fields (#2261).** `select` and `boolean` are unchanged. Every value is
  validated server-side: checkboxes store a list in option order (post
  `name[]`), `number` takes optional min/max/step (whole values store as
  integers), `rating` is an integer 1 to N stars (N up to 10, default 5), `url`
  is http(s) with a host and no credentials, `phone` is 6 to 15 digits, and
  `hidden` is submitter-controlled free text. `GET /api/forms/<slug>` gains
  additive `min`, `max` and `step` keys. List values are joined with `", "` in
  mail, autoresponder tokens, the Entries tab and the CSV export. See
  [docs/forms.md](../forms.md).

## Changed

<a id="search-leg-performance"></a>

- **Global search is several times cheaper on a large catalogue.** A
  downstream catalogue of about 4,900 documents (2,047 herbs with three name
  fields) took 1.2–1.6 s per `/api/search` sweep, so 1.8's 1.5 s
  `query_budget` cut most queries short (`partial: true`). Three legs cost
  most of it, and each was a query-shape problem:
  - **Alias and compound legs.** The match runs "the query contains the
    name", so its tsquery is built from the row, and no index can serve it:
    every search unpacked every row's `custom_fields` and built a tsquery
    per name field. Both legs now first check the row's `name_lexemes` (the
    lexemes and Han runs of its title and names, from `search_weighted`'s
    `A` bucket) against the query's, the way the title leg checks its title
    lexemes, and run the phrase match only on the rows that share one. On a
    synthetic 2,047-row table of the same shape, the alias filter went from
    15 ms to 0.3 ms.
  - **Empty names.** A missing or empty name was matched as `''`, and
    `phraseto_tsquery('')` sends a `NOTICE` to the client for every row: about
    2,500 per herbs query on that catalogue. Empty names are now skipped.
  - **Tag leg.** Every section repeated the same nearest-tag vector search,
    then ran one query per tag. A sweep now looks the tags up once. Each
    section reads the documents carrying any of them in one query, and works
    out per tag which ones it carries. When that read hits its cap, the leg
    goes back to one query per tag, so results and distances don't change.

  Flagging a field `names_record` now also re-fires the type's published
  documents, as flagging it `searchable` already did: the flag reaches
  `search_weighted`, which weights `search_vector` and feeds the new
  prefilter. A draft picks it up on its next save. Before, the alias leg
  saw a new flag on the next search, while `search_vector` kept the old
  weights until each document was saved again. Type promotion
  (`mix kiln.promote_data`) no longer copies generated columns.

<a id="quiet-image-build"></a>

- **The release image builds without warnings or notices from Kiln's own
  steps.** The GHCR build log for v1.8.0 carried about 260 warnings and
  notices. Kiln's own steps produced four kinds, each now gone:
  - Tailwind's CSS optimizer warned that `::highlight(kiln-issue)` is not a
    valid pseudo-element. It is one (the CSS Custom Highlight API), but
    Lightning CSS doesn't know it. The rule now lives in `advisory_jump.js`
    as a constructed stylesheet, adopted the first time a highlight is drawn.
  - `npm ci` printed its "new major version" and "looking for funding"
    notices. The image pins its own npm, so the build passes
    `--no-update-notifier --no-fund`.
  - The two-scheduler `mix compile` pushed dozens of files past the
    "taking more than 10s" notice. The image build raises the threshold;
    dev keeps the default.
  - `mix release` printed "skipping elixir.bat/iex.bat for windows". The
    release now sets `include_executables_for: [:unix]`.

  On the dependency side, ash_phoenix 2.3.26, ash_paper_trail 0.8.1,
  ranch 2.3.0, makeup 1.2.3 and phoenix_template 1.1.0 compile cleanly on
  Elixir 1.20, removing about 20 warnings. The OTP 29 deprecation warnings
  in yamerl, gproc, gen_smtp and chatterbox (`catch Expr`, exported
  subexpression variables, `lists:zf/2`) are switched off for the
  `deps.compile` step only, through the compiler's own `nowarn_*` options.
  The app's sources still compile with every warning on. The rest are Elixir
  1.20 warnings inside third-party packages whose latest releases still
  carry them. Fixing those needs upstream releases.

## Fixed

<a id="phoenix-1-8-16-subscription-pushes"></a>

- **The Phoenix stack moves to 1.8.16 (phoenix_pubsub 2.4.1, phoenix_live_view
  1.2.13, websock_adapter 0.7.0), together with absinthe_phoenix 2.0.6.** Phoenix
  1.8.16 replaces PubSub's custom dispatchers with per-subscription senders:
  Phoenix's channel server dispatcher now passes broadcasts to the default
  dispatch, which ignores the `metadata: {:fastlane, transport_pid, serializer, _}`
  shape. absinthe_phoenix 2.0.5 still subscribes each GraphQL subscription
  document with that metadata. On 1.8.16, a `subscription:data` broadcast
  therefore went to the channel process instead of the socket's transport.
  absinthe_phoenix's channel then dropped it in its catch-all `handle_info`. The
  result was that every subscription accepted the subscribe call and never
  pushed anything, in production as well as in tests (the six failing
  `assert_receive` cases in `graphql_subscription_test.exs` and
  `graphql_limits_test.exs`). absinthe_phoenix 2.0.6 subscribes with a sender
  instead (absinthe_phoenix#113/#114). `mix.exs` now requires
  `absinthe_phoenix >= 2.0.6` and `phoenix ~> 1.8.16`, so the lock can't pair
  them wrongly again.

<a id="exla-fine-pin"></a>

- **A from-scratch `KILN_ML=1` build compiles EXLA again.** The Phoenix
  1.8.16 bump above also moved the test-only `lazy_html` to 0.1.14, which
  requires `fine ~> 0.2.0`, so the lock took fine 0.2.0. EXLA 1.0.0 allows
  `fine ~> 0.1` but its NIF does not compile against 0.2 (`'try_decode' is
  not a member of 'fine::Decoder<xla::Shape>'`). Lean builds were
  unaffected. The `-ml` image and any overlay building with `KILN_ML` on
  failed, and an overlay could not pin around it, since
  `mix kiln.plugins.doctor` holds core dependencies at core's lock.
  `mix.exs` now caps `lazy_html` below 0.1.14, which puts both lock entries
  back to their v1.8.0 versions. CI's ML leg missed the break because EXLA
  caches `libexla.so` under a key without `fine`, and the leg restored that
  cache on the lock change. It now rebuilds the NIF from source whenever its
  cache isn't an exact hit. Overlays that re-seeded `project.lock` from the
  1.8.16 bump re-seed once more.

<a id="new-menu-button"></a>

- **The content list's "New" menu is a real `<button>` with `aria-expanded`.**
  Past three content types, `/editor` folds its "New …" buttons into one
  menu. Its trigger was a `<summary>` styled as a button, with the marker
  hidden; an accessibility walkthrough found it wasn't announced as a button.
  It is now a disclosure: a `<button aria-expanded aria-controls>` that shows
  and hides the panel of per-type buttons. The shared `data-autoclose`
  handler in `app.js` closes it on a click outside or on Escape, and only
  claims Escape while the menu is open, so Escape in the search box or a
  modal keeps its focus. The old `<details>` also lost its `open` state on
  every LiveView patch, so a list refresh behind an open menu snapped it
  shut; the new one keeps its state across patches it didn't cause.

## Security

<a id="ecto-query-cache-advisory"></a>

- **ecto 3.14.3 fixes EEF-CVE-2026-118391 (unbounded query cache growth), and
  ash_sql 0.8.7 replaces the retired 0.8.4 (query cache returned wrong rows).**
  ecto 3.14.2's query cache grew without bound on queries with
  interpolated JSON paths or splice lists (high). ash_sql 0.8.4 was retired for security the
  same day: an Ecto query cache issue could make a query return
  unpredictable results. Both were published 2026-11-04, after 1.8.0, and
  fail `mix hex.audit` on every branch until taken. Lock-only: `mix
  deps.unlock ecto ash_sql`, nothing else moved.
