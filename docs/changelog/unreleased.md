# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Upgrade notes

<a id="a-site-whose-code-injection-snippet-opens-a-websocket-to-its-vendor-must"></a>

- **A site whose code-injection snippet opens a websocket to its vendor must
  now list that `wss://` origin under Connections.** The stock `connect-src`
  no longer carries `ws: wss:` (see Security), and an `https://` source does
  not admit a `wss://` URL, so a chat or live-analytics widget pasted into
  Settings → Code injection that talks to its vendor over a websocket is
  refused by the browser after the upgrade — look for a `connect-src`
  violation naming a `wss://` URL in the public site's console. Add that
  origin (e.g. `wss://relay.widget.example`) to the Connections list; the
  field now accepts `wss://` origins, and only that field does. A snippet that
  only `fetch`es or beacons needs nothing
  ([#1615](https://github.com/The-Verscienta/kiln_cms/issues/1615)).

## Fixed

<a id="a-429s-retry-after-is-rounded-up-never-0"></a>

- **A 429's `retry-after` is rounded up, never 0.** The per-IP rate limiter
  truncated the time left in its fixed window to whole seconds, so a client
  refused in the window's last second was told `retry-after: 0` and retried
  straight back into the closed window. The docs publisher honours the header:
  it spent all three retries within a few milliseconds and failed the v0.11.0
  docs sync a moment before the window reopened. The plug now rounds the same
  way `AccountThrottle.retry_after_seconds/1` already did for the second-factor
  budget — up, and never below one. `scripts/publish_docs.exs` also waits at
  least a second on any 429 and retries up to five times, since a full sync
  (~3 requests a guide) is larger than the `:api` bucket and keeps talking to
  sites that haven't picked this fix up.

## Security

<a id="the-browser-csps-connect-src-is-self-alone-no-websocket-to-any"></a>

- **The browser CSP's `connect-src` is `'self'` alone — no websocket to any
  other host.** It had been `'self' ws: wss:` since the first skeleton commit,
  which let any script that got past `script-src` open a websocket to any host
  — an exfiltration channel, which is what `connect-src` exists to close. Every
  socket Kiln's own pages open is same-origin (`/live` and its longpoll
  fallback, `/ws/collab`, `/ws/gql`), and CSP3 matches `'self'` against
  `ws:`/`wss:` on the page's own host and port, so the scheme sources only ever
  admitted *other* hosts. No browser code in Kiln connects cross-origin:
  uploads ride the LiveView channel, the presigned-upload API is for API
  clients, oEmbed and Unsplash are resolved server-side, and `bridge.js` runs
  on the external front end under that site's own policy. A new Playwright
  spec (`e2e/tests/csp.spec.js`) drives the console, an editor, the media
  library, a public page and the same page on a second host name with zero
  CSP violations, and shows a socket to another origin is now refused. The
  same pass reviewed `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` (kept: templates use inline
  `style=` attributes, which cannot carry a nonce) and the runtime
  `img-src`/`media-src` widening (kept: every source is operator
  configuration, a fixed provider list, or the site's own bucket origin);
  threat-model residual 12 now records the reviewed policy
  ([#1615](https://github.com/The-Verscienta/kiln_cms/issues/1615)).
