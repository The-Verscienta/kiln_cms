# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Added

<a id="one-click-deploy-templates-for-render-railway-flyio-and-digitalocean"></a>

- **One-click deploy templates for Render, Railway, Fly.io and DigitalOcean.**
  `render.yaml` (with a Deploy to Render button), `fly.toml`, `.do/app.yaml`
  and a Railway recipe each run the published image at a pinned tag, with
  Postgres 17 and pgvector and with media kept across restarts. The steps,
  costs and caveats for each are in `docs/deploy-platforms.md`, including
  what none of them solves yet: no platform documents its proxy's address
  range, so per-IP rate limiting behind one is per-deployment until a
  follow-up reads the platform's client-IP header. None has yet been deployed
  end to end; the page says so.

<a id="kilnmediaroot-a-stable-directory-for-local-media"></a>

- **`KILN_MEDIA_ROOT`: a stable directory for local media.** Unset, the Local
  storage adapter writes under the release's own `priv/uploads` — in the image
  `/app/lib/kiln_cms-<version>/priv/uploads`, a path that moves with every
  version, so no volume could be mounted to keep uploads across an upgrade or
  a PaaS restart. Set, public files go to `<dir>/public` (served at
  `/uploads`, which now reads the adapter's root per request instead of a
  compiled-in path) and private ones to `<dir>/private`. The in-app backup and
  `scripts/backup.sh` default `MEDIA_DIR` to it, the image creates
  `/app/media` owned by `nobody`, and boot reports a directory the app cannot
  write to. Ignored under S3.

## Fixed

<a id="a-paas-health-check-no-longer-gets-a-redirect-and-phxhost-falls-back-to-the"></a>

- **A PaaS health check no longer gets a redirect, and `PHX_HOST` falls back
  to the platform's hostname.** `force_ssl` answered a platform's
  plain-HTTP probe of `/up` with a 301, which a platform that counts only 2xx
  reads as a failed deploy; `/live` and `/up` now answer over plain HTTP
  (`/ready`, which carries queue depths, still redirects). With `PHX_HOST`
  unset or blank the host is now `RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME`,
  `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` or `<FLY_APP_NAME>.fly.dev` before `example.com`, so
  a fresh deploy's editor connects; a blank `PHX_HOST` used to become an empty
  host.
