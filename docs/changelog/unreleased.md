# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Fixed

<a id="a-429s-retry-after-is-rounded-up-never-0"></a>

- **A 429's `retry-after` is rounded up, never 0.** The per-IP rate limiter
  truncated the time left in its fixed window to whole seconds, so a client
  refused in the window's last second was told `retry-after: 0` and retried
  straight back into the closed window. The docs publisher honours the header:
  it spent all three retries within a few milliseconds and failed the v0.11.0
  docs sync a moment before the window reopened. The plug now rounds the same
  way `AccountThrottle.retry_after_seconds/1` already did for the second-factor
  budget — up, and never below one. `scripts/publish_docs.exs` also waits at
  least a second on any 429 and retries up to five times, since a full sync
  (~3 requests a guide) is larger than the `:api` bucket and keeps talking to
  sites that haven't picked this fix up.
