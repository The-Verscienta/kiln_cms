# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Upgrade notes

<a id="before-upgrading-make-every-webhook-receiver-verify-x-kilncms-webhook-signature"></a>

- **Before upgrading, make every webhook receiver verify
  `x-kilncms-webhook-signature`.** From this release a delivery no longer
  carries the body-only `x-kilncms-signature`, so a receiver that checks only
  that header rejects every delivery (or, if it treats a missing header as
  "unsigned, accept", stops verifying at all). Switch each receiver to the
  timestamped header first — both headers have been sent on every delivery
  since 0.10.0, so the switch needs no coordination with the upgrade. Use
  `verifyWebhook` from the JS client, `KilnClient.Webhook.verify/4` from the
  Elixir client, or the procedure in `docs/webhooks.md`: split the header into
  `t` and `v1`, reject a `t` more than 300 seconds from your clock, and compare
  `v1` in constant time with the HMAC-SHA256 of `"<t>.<raw body>"` under the
  endpoint's secret. Deliveries already queued when you upgrade go out with
  the new headers only
  ([#1616](https://github.com/The-Verscienta/kiln_cms/issues/1616)).

## Breaking

<a id="webhook-deliveries-no-longer-send-x-kilncms-signature"></a>

- **Webhook deliveries no longer send `x-kilncms-signature`.** The body-only
  HMAC, deprecated in 0.10.0, proved a delivery's origin but not its
  freshness: a captured request replayed to a receiver that checked only that
  header verified forever. `x-kilncms-webhook-signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex>`
  (added in 0.10.0) is now the only signature, which closes threat-model residual risk
  15 for every receiver that verifies. `KilnCMS.Webhooks`' `signature/2` and
  `signature_header/0` are gone with it; `timestamped_signature/3` and
  `verify/4` are unchanged. The JS and Elixir client helpers already verified
  only the timestamped header and need no change
  ([#1616](https://github.com/The-Verscienta/kiln_cms/issues/1616)).

## Fixed

<a id="a-429s-retry-after-is-rounded-up-never-0"></a>

- **A 429's `retry-after` is rounded up, never 0.** The per-IP rate limiter
  truncated the time left in its fixed window to whole seconds, so a client
  refused in the window's last second was told `retry-after: 0` and retried
  straight back into the closed window. The docs publisher honours the header:
  it spent all three retries within a few milliseconds and failed the v0.11.0
  docs sync a moment before the window reopened. The plug now rounds the same
  way `AccountThrottle.retry_after_seconds/1` already did for the second-factor
  budget — up, and never below one. `scripts/publish_docs.exs` also waits at
  least a second on any 429 and retries up to five times, since a full sync
  (~3 requests a guide) is larger than the `:api` bucket and keeps talking to
  sites that haven't picked this fix up.
