# KilnCMS Unreleased — full release notes

The long-form entries behind the Unreleased section of
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md), as they were written when each change
merged. `CHANGELOG.md` carries the one-line summary of each; this file
carries the reasoning.

## Fixed

- **Buttons, links, badges and fields that rendered unstyled now look like what
  they are.** The console's component kit borrows DaisyUI's class names without
  the dependency, and a dozen templates still used DaisyUI classes the kit never
  defined — so they compiled, rendered, and styled nothing. "Turn on outbound
  checking" on `/editor/links` read as plain text: `<.button class="…">`
  replaced the component's own `btn btn-primary` classes instead of adding to
  them, which also stripped mail settings' "Unsuppress". The same shape was
  behind the social accounts "Remove" button (`btn-error`), sixteen `class="link"`
  anchors that Tailwind's preflight had reduced to body text, borderless date and
  note fields in the editor's task form (`input`, `textarea`), status pills on
  experiments, federation and governance (`badge-*`, now `<.badge>`), the error
  on a passphrase-protected page (`alert`), and oversized `btn-xs` buttons. The
  kit gains `.link` and `.field-label` for the call sites that already used them,
  and a test now fails on any DaisyUI-named class in the web layer that
  `assets/css/app.css` does not define.
